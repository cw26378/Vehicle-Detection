<h3><strong>Vehicle Detection Project</strong></h3>
<p>The goals / steps of this project are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier</li>
<li>Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. </li>
<li>Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.</li>
<li>Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.</li>
<li>Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.</li>
<li>Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)</h3>
<h4>1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.</h4>
<p>I have put everything in one notebook <code>Project5_vehicle_detection_12-31-17</code>. The code for this step is contained in function called <code>extract_HOG_features</code> ,where function<code>get_HOG_features</code> is called for each image.  </p>
<p>I started by reading in all the <code>vehicle</code> and <code>non-vehicle</code> images.  Here is an example of one of each of the <code>vehicle</code> and <code>non-vehicle</code> classes:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="./output_images/car_noncar_example.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to HOG features, I also used sptial bin of RGB channels and histogram in function<code>extract_spatial_features</code>. Functions <code>spatial_bin</code> and <code>color_hist</code> in the code are built for sptial bin and pixel histogram feature. I then explored different color spaces and different parameters (<code>orientations</code>, <code>pixels_per_cell</code>, and <code>cells_per_block</code>).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the HOG output looks like.</p>
<p>Here is an example using the <code>YCrCb</code> color space and HOG parameters of <code>orientations=9</code>, <code>pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)</code> and <code>cells_per_block=(2, 2)</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="./output_images/HOG_Feature.png" /></p>
<h4>2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.</h4>
<p>After comparing the result of the HOG feature from different channels. I narrowed down to a few candidate including <code>YCrCb</code> and <code>HLS</code>, and the orientation and pixels per cell, cell per block remain at 9, (8,8), 2. The final decision is made after training the SVM with each combined features and parameters. HOG from <code>YCrCb</code> channel gave the highest accuracy at 0.9893. And the false positive is minimal in later test on images.  </p>
<h4>3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).</h4>
<p>I trained a linear SVM using combination of RGB spatial bin, histogram, and YCrCb HOG features. It is critical to normalize the data. Note that without normalizing the data, the training model will still yield an apparently OK number of model accuracy. But in reality will cause a lot of false positives (cars flowing everywhere!). The normalization is shown in the following:</p>

<h3>Sliding Window Search</h3>
<h4>1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?</h4>
<p>Sliding window search is implemented in function <code>slide_window()</code>. I decided to not limit search in x-direction, which is mostly fine. But for y direction I cropped out the hood and sky to accerlerate the processing. The scales are tested and carefully chosen depending on if the searched region is far or near (scale ratio searched ranging from 0.5-4 given the realistic sizes of cars in images scale scale =1 for 64 pixels). I found <code>xy_overlap</code>=(0.5, 0.5) is reasonable, and the use of different scales will to some extent cover the missing information due to samll overlap or big stride.  </p>
<h4>2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?</h4>
<p>Ultimately I searched on a combination of 3-4 scales (depending on whether the search is at the far or near region) using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:</p>

<h3>Video Implementation</h3>
<h4>1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)</h4>
<p>Please find my video in the submission.</p>
<h4>2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.</h4>
<p>I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video. As the following figure indicates, there are lots of false positives. From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions. Since I used mutliple scales, my threshold is higher than just 1 or 0. I then used <code>scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()</code> to identify individual blobs in the heatmap. I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  For single image detection, I found that threhold = 5 or 6 is sufficient. For video, I intentionally lowered the threshold to 3-4 but rely on the history data to serve as a filter.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="./output_images/YCrCb_result_BOX.png" /></p>
<p>Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a 3 images, the result of labeled points then overlaid on the next images.It is clearly showing that false positives are effectively filtered by considering the detection in the history. This is a straightfoward but a little bit rough approach. Another way is to keep the highlighted box from earlier frames and average them.</p>
<h4>Here are three images in a queue and their effect on the final heatmap:</h4>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?</h4>
<p>I feel like the project is a manual way of implementating CNN, and used human's knowledge to narrow down the good effective features in stead of letting the model to learn the features from the time/energy consuming training. My pipeline may have trouble if there are cars coming from the opposite side of road. If the lane lines are filled with cars bumper to bumper, like what big cities are used to, the detections just all merge and I will see a big blue box, not very informative... And when the car is not of a regular shape (tractors or motorcycles), the model will have difficulty. </p>
